# MENTA
A *simple* framework for creating Tendermint blockchain applications.  

Why not just use the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) ?  Good question. If you're building a public application or planning to deploy to Cosmos, you should definitely use it!  

This framework is for:
* rapid prototyping and small pilot projects  
* folks looking to build Tendermint apps that may not be destined for the Cosmos, or 
* folks wanting to learn *how* a Tendermint ABCI works through a relatively small code base.

Menta intentionally mimics, adapts, and uses code from the Cosmos SDK.  I use this framework as a way to help me stay in tune with what's happening under the covers with Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK.

**Current supported Tendermint version: 0.29.0**

Get it: `dep ensure -add github.com/davebryson/menta`
